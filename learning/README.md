# Learning prompts

AI prompts designed to support learning, self-education, and structured understanding of complex topics.

The focus is on comprehension, reasoning, and knowledge transfer rather than memorization or formal testing.

## Use cases

Prompts in this directory are used for:

- learning new topics through structured dialogue,
- deepening understanding of complex concepts,
- breaking down difficult material into clear mental models,
- studying through questioning, explanation, and iteration,
- developing analytical and critical thinking skills.

## Language note

Most prompts are written in Russian.

This is intentional, as learning quality strongly depends on language nuance, precision of explanations, and conceptual clarity.
