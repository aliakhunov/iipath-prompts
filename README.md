# iipath — Practical Prompts

This repository contains a curated collection of practical AI prompts designed for real work.

The prompts are used to support analysis, structured thinking, communication, learning, and decision-making in everyday professional scenarios.

Most prompts are written in Russian and reflect real-world work with Russian-speaking stakeholders.

## What this repository is about

This is not a showcase of “clever prompts”.

These prompts are:
- built from real cases,
- refined through repeated use,
- focused on practical outcomes rather than creative play.

They are intended to be **working tools**.

---

## Who this is for

This repository will be useful if you:
- use AI in real work tasks, not just for exploration,
- need structured reasoning, not raw generation,
- work with stakeholders, requirements, texts, or decisions,
- want repeatable prompt patterns instead of one-off tricks.

Typical use cases include analysis, communication, learning, and decision support.

## Repository structure

Prompts are organized by **type of thinking**, not by industry or hype topics.

/prompts
/analysis
/creation
/decision_support
/learning
/communication
/experiments


Each prompt is stored as a separate file and includes:
- purpose and context,
- the prompt itself,
- usage notes,
- example output (where applicable).

---

## Language note

Most prompts are written in **Russian**.

This is intentional:
- many real-world tasks depend on language nuance,
- stakeholder communication and requirements work are language-sensitive,
- translation often degrades prompt quality.

Where helpful, prompts include short English descriptions for navigation.

## How to use

1. Open a prompt file relevant to your task.
2. Read the context and usage notes.
3. Use the prompt as-is or adapt it to your situation.
4. Treat prompts as tools — adjust, iterate, improve.

---

## Status

This repository is actively maintained and expanded.
Prompts may be updated as approaches evolve.
