# Visual generation prompts

AI prompts for generating visual content: images, scenes, styles, and visual concepts.

This directory focuses on controlling composition, style, mood, and constraints of visual output, rather than producing random or purely aesthetic results.

---

## Use cases

Prompts in this directory are used for:
- image generation,
- scene and environment description,
- style imitation and visual consistency,
- visualization of ideas, products, and concepts.

The priority is predictable and controllable output.

---

## Scope

Prompts are tool-agnostic and are not tied to a specific platform or model.

They describe what should be generated and how it should look, independently of the underlying visual generation system.

---

## Language note

All prompts in this directory are written in **Russian**.

This is intentional, as visual prompts often rely on precise linguistic nuance and stylistic control that is tightly connected to the source language.
